# 1. Problem Statement

## Problem Title

Unpredictable Inventory Demand and Stock Imbalance in SMEs

## Problem Description

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) struggle to forecast product demand accurately using traditional spreadsheet-based or manual methods. These approaches fail to capture seasonality, trends, and demand volatility, leading to inefficient inventory decisions.

As a result, businesses face:

- Frequent stockouts and lost sales
- Excess inventory and increased holding costs
- Capital lock-in and cash flow issues
- Reactive and inefficient supply chain planning

## Target Users

- Retail Store Managers
- Inventory Planners
- E-commerce Store Owners
- FMCG Distributors
- Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) Brands

## Existing Gaps

- Excel-based forecasting ignores seasonality and trends
- Manual forecasting introduces human bias
- Enterprise-grade ERP systems are costly and complex
- Most AI tools require heavy infrastructure
- Forecast uncertainty and safety stock are rarely quantified

---

# 2. Problem Understanding & Approach

## Root Cause Analysis

Inventory demand is inherently time-series data composed of:

- Trend: long-term growth or decline
- Seasonality: recurring periodic patterns
- Residual noise: random fluctuations

Most SMEs lack:

- Time-series decomposition techniques
- Scientific model evaluation methods
- Statistical safety stock computation
- Interpretable forecasting tools

## Solution Strategy

Design a full-stack AI system that:

- Accepts historical SKU-level sales data
- Automatically validates and preprocesses CSV input
- Trains multiple forecasting models
- Selects the best-performing model using RMSE
- Computes confidence intervals and safety stock
- Generates actionable restocking insights
- Presents results via an intuitive dashboard

---

# 3. Proposed Solution

## ER Diagram Description

The MVP uses in-memory processing to ensure fast computation and protect user data privacy. Sales data is parsed, structured, and grouped by SKU. Future versions can integrate PostgreSQL for persistence and Redis for caching.

---

# 6. Dataset Selected

## Dataset Name

Retail SKU Demand Dataset (Synthetic Sample Data)

## Source

Custom-generated datasets:

- example_data.csv
- advanced_retail_demand.csv

## Data Type

Time-series sales data at SKU level

## Selection Reason

Contains realistic SKU-level historical demand patterns with seasonal variation and trend behavior suitable for forecasting.

## Preprocessing Steps

- Date parsing and validation
- Chronological sorting
- Missing value handling
- Frequency detection
- SKU-wise grouping
- Time-series array conversion

---

# 7. Model Selected

## Model Name

Ensemble Time-Series Forecasting System  
(Components: Moving Average, Holt-Winters, Prophet)

## Selection Reasoning

- Moving Average: baseline smoothing
- Holt-Winters: trend and seasonality modeling
- Prophet: change-point and multi-seasonality handling
- Ensemble approach improves robustness

## Alternatives Considered

- ARIMA: complex parameter tuning
- LSTM: requires large datasets and GPUs
- Single-model approaches: insufficient accuracy

## Evaluation Metrics

- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Residual standard deviation
- 95% confidence interval bounds
