1. Problem Statement
   Problem Title

Unpredictable Inventory Demand and Stock Imbalance in SMEs

Problem Description

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) struggle to forecast product demand accurately using traditional spreadsheet-based or manual methods. These approaches fail to capture seasonality, trends, and demand volatility, leading to inefficient inventory decisions.

As a result, businesses face:

Frequent stockouts and lost sales

Excess inventory and increased holding costs

Capital lock-in and cash flow issues

Reactive and inefficient supply chain planning

Target Users

Retail Store Managers

Inventory Planners

E-commerce Store Owners

FMCG Distributors

Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) Brands

Existing Gaps

Excel-based forecasting ignores seasonality and trends

Manual forecasting introduces human bias

Enterprise-grade ERP systems are costly and complex

Most AI tools require heavy infrastructure

Forecast uncertainty and safety stock are rarely quantified

2. Problem Understanding & Approach
   Root Cause Analysis

Inventory demand is inherently time-series data composed of:

Trend: long-term growth or decline

Seasonality: recurring periodic patterns

Residual noise: random fluctuations

Most SMEs lack:

Time-series decomposition techniques

Scientific model evaluation methods

Statistical safety stock computation

Interpretable forecasting tools

Solution Approach

Design a full-stack AI system that:

Accepts historical SKU-level sales data

Automatically validates and preprocesses CSV input

Trains multiple forecasting models

Selects the best-performing model using RMSE

Computes confidence intervals and safety stock

Generates actionable restocking insights

Presents results via an intuitive dashboard

3. Proposed Solution
   Solution Overview

SmartStock AI is a SaaS-style web application that provides SKU-level demand forecasting and automated restocking recommendations using ensemble time-series models.

Core Idea

Democratize enterprise-grade inventory forecasting by delivering accurate, interpretable, and automated AI insights through a simple web interface.

Key Features

CSV upload with schema validation

SKU-level demand forecasting

Ensemble forecasting engine

Moving Average

Holt-Winters

Prophet

Automatic model selection using RMSE

Time-series decomposition

Forecast confidence intervals

Safety stock and reorder point calculation

Business insight generation

4. System Architecture
   High-Level Flow

User → Frontend → Backend → Forecasting Models → Response

Architecture Description

Frontend (React + Vite)

User interface and dashboard

SKU selection and KPI display

Forecast and confidence interval visualization

Backend (FastAPI)

CSV ingestion and validation

Forecast execution and metric computation

Business logic and insights generation

Model Layer

Multiple forecasting models

RMSE-based model comparison

Confidence interval computation

Database Layer (MVP)

In-memory data processing

Optional local caching

Response Layer

JSON output containing forecasts, metrics, and recommendations

5. Data Management & Design
   Data Handling Strategy

The MVP uses in-memory processing to:

Ensure fast computation

Protect user data privacy

Avoid external storage dependency

Sales data is parsed, structured, and grouped by SKU.
Future versions can integrate PostgreSQL for persistence and Redis for caching.

6. Dataset Description
   Dataset Used

Retail SKU Demand Dataset (Synthetic Sample Data)

Source

Custom-generated datasets:

example_data.csv

advanced_retail_demand.csv

Data Type

Time-series sales data at SKU level

Preprocessing Steps

Date parsing and validation

Chronological sorting

Missing value handling

Frequency detection

SKU-wise grouping

Time-series array conversion

7. Forecasting Models
   Model Architecture

Ensemble Time-Series Forecasting System

Components:

Moving Average

Holt-Winters

Prophet

Model Selection Rationale

Moving Average: baseline smoothing

Holt-Winters: trend and seasonality modeling

Prophet: change-point and multi-seasonality handling

Ensemble approach improves robustness

Alternatives Considered

ARIMA: complex parameter tuning

LSTM: requires large datasets and GPUs

Single-model approaches: insufficient accuracy

Evaluation Metrics

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Residual standard deviation

95% confidence interval bounds
